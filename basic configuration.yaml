      Determines which players are connected to which players. Connections
      between two players correlate to potential speaker-listener or
      listener-advisor pairs. The format of the structure is a string where
      connections between two different player nodes are separated by a hyphen (
      - ), and different connections are separated by a comma ( , ) . For
      example, "1-2, 1-3" means that player 1 has connections to both player 2
      and 3. Player roles are chosen randomly within the game.
